IP Validator
============

This is a validator made in Java to verify if a String is a valid IP. It was made during my Softare Engineering Fundamentals (CES-28) course, and it was used Test Driven Development (TDD) to make it.

Warning for users
-----------------

As it was made in Eclipse 4.2.2, it has the necessary plugins and metadata (no .gitignore). If you are only interested in the classes, go to Validator/src, where you can find:

* validate_IP: a package that contains IP_Validator, a Class that has the algorithm for the IP validation;
* validate_IP_tests: a package that contains IP_Validator_Test, a Class with all the JUnit tests required by IP_Validator.
